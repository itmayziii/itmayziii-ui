# itmayziii-ui
SSG frontend for [tommymay.dev][tommymay-dev] powered by [Astro.][astro]

## Contributing

### Local Setup
1. You will need to be running the related [API][itmayziii-api] to be able to fetch data from the headless CMS.

2. Setup environment variables by copying `.env.example` -> `.env` and filling out the missing environment variables.
    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
   
3. Run `npm start` to start the [astro dev server][astro-dev] with hot reloading.


## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
